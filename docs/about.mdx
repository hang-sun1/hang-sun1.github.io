# About me

> I am a third year student at the University of Washington in Seattle. I started coding in high-school, and
> have only developed a greater love for it as time went on. Although my course work and major is in biochemistry,
> I recently realized that programming is my true passion. Despite my lack of computer science coursework, I am
> an avid hobby programmer and have made sure to develop my skills over the years, a fact that I hope is demonstrated by
> the projects shown on this site.
